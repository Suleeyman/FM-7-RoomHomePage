## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Implement a background on images, a "`mask`".

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.mask {
  background: linear-gradient(270deg, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0001) 0%, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.601863) 100%);
}
```
Also learned how to make a bit more advanced hover effects with `clip-path` CSS property with ::after pseudo-element.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
Moreover, this challenge has involved me to use `display: grid;`, and I tried my best with.
